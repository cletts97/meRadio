Implementation of my CO620 Research Project at University of Kent

This is an application targeted at dementia patients which scrapes a user's Facebook feed, feeds any images in to an image captioning model, and then generates a full script of the user's Facebook feed (intended to be read by a Text-To-Speech model).

Input updated access token in Main.py, then run main.py to produce script.
